# Onboarding Feedback Guide

This guide provides two fast channels for onboarding feedback:

1. GitHub issue template (preferred)
2. Manual form (copy/paste)

Related tracker issue: `#6`

## Option 1: GitHub Issue Template (Preferred)

Open a new issue and choose **Onboarding feedback**:

- URL: `https://github.com/dtsong/my-opencode-codex-setup/issues/new/choose`
- Template file: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/onboarding_feedback.md`

Why preferred:
- keeps feedback structured and searchable
- makes follow-up actions easier to triage
- links directly to onboarding validation tracking

## Option 2: Manual Feedback Form

Copy and fill this template if someone cannot use GitHub issues:

```markdown
## Onboarding Feedback

- Participant alias:
- Date:
- OS:
- Shell:
- Repo commit/tag used:

### Commands Run
```text
Paste exact commands run.
```

### Result
- Outcome: success | partial | fail
- Time-to-first-success (minutes):

### Friction Points
-

### Errors/Output (if any)
```text
Paste relevant logs or errors.
```

### Suggested Improvements
-

### Would you recommend this onboarding flow?
- yes | no | maybe
```

If feedback is collected manually, add it as a comment on issue `#6` so it counts toward the 3-confirmation gate.
